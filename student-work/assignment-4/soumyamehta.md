Hi! My favorite programming language is **Rust** because of its speed, safety, and excellent memory management. I love working with Rust for data analysis and graph algorithms.  

## Example Code  

Hereâ€™s a simple Rust program that prints "Hello, World!"  

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
This program defines the main function, which prints "Hello, World!" to the console. You can run it using:rustc main.rs
./main
