Hi, my name is Gia Gupta and my favorite programming language is Python because I love how simple and versatile it is for data science and automation tasks!

## Example code

```python
import random

def random_greeting():
    greetings = ["Hello!", "Hi there!", "Greetings!", "Hey!", "What's up?"]
    print(random.choice(greetings))

random_greeting()
## Code explanation

This script displays a random greeting each time it is run. To execute the code, save it to a file named `greetings.py` and run it using the terminal command `python greetings.py`. You need to have Python installed to run the script.
