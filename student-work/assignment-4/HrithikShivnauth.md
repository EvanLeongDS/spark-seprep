Hello! My favorite programming language is **Python** because of its simplicity.

## Example code

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```
## Code Explanation 

This code defines a python function greet that takes a simple input and returns a greeting message. In order to run it you can save the code in a file called greet.py. Then you naviagte to your directory of the file and run the code.
