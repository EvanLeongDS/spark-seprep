#Liam Durcan

My name is Liam, and I'm a freshman in CDS at BU. My favorite 
programming language is Python because I'm the most familiar with 
it and it seems like the easiest to learn in my experience.

##Example Code

for num in nums:
	num += 1

### Code Explanation
The above code iterates through a list of numbers, nums, and adds 1
to the value of each element, which we called num for the sake of the
for loop.
