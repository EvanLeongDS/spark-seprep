#Ghaith Al Ramahi
My favorite programming language is python because it is the most intuitive and contains so many useful libraries.
##Example Code
"""
import time, math

for i in range(50):
    print(" " * int(10 + 10 * math.sin(i / 3)), "*")
    time.sleep(0.1)
"""
###Code explanation 
Makes an oscilating wave.
