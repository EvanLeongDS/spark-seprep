Hey, I'm Riwaz and my favorite pogramming language is python. I like python because it is a versatile and easily readable language. While it may not be as fast as other languages, python's numerous libraries allows you to do almost anything using the language.

## Example Code

```
randomlist = [1,"hi",5,3,6,23,64,True,"kldss"]
for i in randomlist:
	print(i)
```

### Code Explanation

This code runs when the section is run. The code iterates through a list of random values and prints each value. The fun thing about lists in python is that it can store values of differing types.
