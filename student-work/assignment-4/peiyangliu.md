Hi, my name is Peiyang Liu and my favorite programing language is Python because it's so easy!

## Example code 

```
for i in range(10):
	print('Hello World!')

```
### Code explanation

This script will print 'Hello World!' 10 times to cheer you up. To make this script run, you have to have Python installed correctly. You can find Python documentation [here](https://www.python.org/)
