Hi, my name is Hassan Dawy and my favorite programming language is Python because it is the perfect balance of all languages in my opinion.

## Example Code 
```
def fib(n):
    if n ==0:
        return 0
    elif n ==1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

```
### Code Explanation
This is a code about the fibonacci series and to run it you should print(fib(n)) with n being the number of how many fibonacci series digits you want.
