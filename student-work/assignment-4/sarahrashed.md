# Sarah Rashed
Hi my name is Sarah. My favorite programming language is Python because it is so versitile and easy to learn.

# Example Code
```Python
def even_print():
    for i in range(0,11,2):
        print(i)

    print("some even numbers!")
```

# Code Explanation
The function `even_print()` prints even numbers from 0 to 10. This is specified by the step size being 2. It does not take any input and you can simply run `even_print()`.
