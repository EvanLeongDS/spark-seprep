#Aymen Tiguite

Hi, my name is Aymen Tiguite, and my favorite programming language is Python because I love its simplicity and versatility in solving real-world problems!

## Example code

```
import random
import time

def main():
    random.seed(time.time())
    quotes = [
        "The best way to predict the future is to invent it. – Alan Kay",
        "Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad. – Cory House",
        "Programming isn't about what you know; it's about what you can figure out. – Chris Pine",
        "The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it. – Dennis Ritchie",
    ]
    print(random.choice(quotes))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Code Explanation

This script prints a random programming-related quote each time you run it. Here's how it works: Import random: Imports the random module to generate random numbers. Quotes: A list of programming-related quotes. Random.choice(quotes): Selects and prints a random quote from the list. To Run Save the code in a file named quotes.py. Open a terminal and run: python quotes.py
