My favourite programming language is Java. It is the first language I
learnt!

## Example Code

```
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
  }
}
```

### Code Explanation

This is a simple Java program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.To run this Java program, follow these steps. First, save the code in a file named Main.java, ensuring the file name matches the class name (Main). Next, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where Main.java is saved. Then, use the javac command to compile the Java code into bytecode by running javac Main.java. This will generate a file named Main.class, which contains the compiled bytecode. Finally, use the java command to execute the compiled program by typing java Main. When you run this command, the program will output Hello, World! to the console.
