# Christian Hilario

Hi, my name is Christian Hilario and my favorite programming language is Python because the syntax is the most readible and the code makes sense, while everything being systematically logical due to i being object-oriented. An example of this is making a simple class with functions.

## Example Code
```
class Animal:
        def __init__(self, name, species):
            self.name = name
            self.species = species

        def __str__(self):
            return f"{self.name} is a {self.species}"

        def make_sound(self:
            print("Generic animal sound")

animal1 = Animal("Generic Animal", "Unknown")
print(animal1)
animal1.make_sound()
```

### Code Explanation
This script is a simple animal class that has a constructor and simple functions that classify the animal and a function that makes a sound. You can add more functionality to it by adding more 
functions and you may implement inheritance of different types of animals by initializing animals under the super class "Animal." You can run it and the output will be the introduction of animal1 and
the sound that it makes. Of course, you may add more complex and cooler features, but this is a basic template.
