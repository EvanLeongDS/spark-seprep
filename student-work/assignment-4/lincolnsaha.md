# Lincoln Saha

My favorite programming language is python because it is the first programming language that I have learned, and it is super versatile along with syntax that is not too difficult to understand.

## Example code

```
def greet(name):
	return f"Hello, {name}!"

print greet("Lincoln")
```

### Code Explanation
This Python program defines a simple function to greet a user.

- The function `greet(name)` takes a string parameter `name` and returns a formatted greeting message using an f-string.
- The `print()` function calls `greet("Lincoln")`, passing "Lincoln" as an argument, which returns "Hello, Lincoln!" and prints it to the console.

#### How to Run
1. Save the file as `greet.py`.
2. Open Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
3. Click on File > Open Folder and select the folder where `greet.py` is saved.
4. Open the `greet.py` file in VSCode.
5. Click on the Run button at the top
6. You should see the text `Hello, Lincoln!` printed on the screen.
