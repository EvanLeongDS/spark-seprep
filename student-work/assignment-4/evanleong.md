Hi, I'm Evan Leong!
Other people call me Dr. Shaquille Oatmeal
My favorite programming language is python because it has many useful application from machine learning to web development. 

##  Example code
'''
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

linear_model = LinearRegression()
x = x.reshape(-1,1) # reshapes data into desired shape, -1 is make it fit, 1 is just 1 column
linear_model.fit(x,y)
y_predict = linear_model.predict(x)

# Visualize the points:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(x,y,'o')
plt.plot(x,y_predict,'r')
plt.show() # scatterplot
'''
### Code explanation
This is a linear regression and visualization function from python, I was trying to find a correlation between milk prices. I use sklearn and matplotlib. 
You can run this code on google colab and find your own dataset! https://colab.research.google.com/
